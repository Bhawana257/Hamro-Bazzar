For your GitHub repository, you want a README that is clean, professional, and easy for other developers (or recruiters) to read. This is the first thing they see when they click your link.

Here is a human-friendly, well-structured description for your Hamro Bazzar repository:

Hamro Bazzar – Full-Stack E-Commerce Platform 🛍️

Hamro Bazzar (meaning "Our Market" in Nepali) is a full-stack web application built using the MEN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Node.js). This project was developed as part of my BCA curriculum to demonstrate a complete e-commerce workflow—from product discovery to order placement.


🚀 Key Features

Dynamic Product Listing: Products are fetched directly from MongoDB and rendered using Vanilla JavaScript, meaning no product data is hardcoded.



Persistent Shopping Cart: The cart is stored server-side in the user's database document, so items remain saved even after logging out or switching devices.



Order Management: Includes a checkout flow that captures delivery details and saves an order history with a "price snapshot" for accuracy.



User Authentication: A functional registration and login system that manages user sessions via localStorage.



Interactive UI: Features an auto-playing hero banner built with Slick Carousel and responsive navigation.


🛠️ Tech Stack

Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+), and jQuery for the homepage slider.



Backend: Node.js and Express.js for the REST API.



Database: MongoDB Atlas with Mongoose for data modeling and schema enforcement.



Security & Config: Dotenv for managing environment variables and protected API keys.
